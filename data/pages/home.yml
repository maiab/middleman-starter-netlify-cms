  title: Fintech Book Club
story: >-
  Fintech is kinda a hard industry to break into. Most people working in fintech come from a
  consumer tech background, and are new to integrating with legacy financial 
  infrastruction, regulations, and how money moves (or doesn't). 
  I started this book club for people who have jumped into the deep end and
  want to learn more about the finance part of fintech.
