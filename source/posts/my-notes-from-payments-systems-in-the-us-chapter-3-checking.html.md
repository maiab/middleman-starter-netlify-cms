Hi crew -\
\
As a reminder, tomorrow at 5pm Pacific we'll be discussing the first chapters of Payments Systems in the US. If you want a calendar invite, make sure to fill out the form on the homepage here.\
\
I will bring some specific questions but if you have questions, topics you particularly want to cover, or ways that this affects your work, feel free to hit the reply button and I'll incorporate them into tomorrow's call. It's just one hour and we'll start and end with some networking so should be pretty snappy overall!

* 5:00-5:15: breakout rooms, please introduce yourself
* 5:15-5:45: discussion
* 5:45-5:55: breakout rooms
* 5:55-6:00: closing

If you haven't acquired or read the book yet, it's not too late, [get a kindle version](https://amzn.to/2Df5aWJ) and just read Chapters 1-3 (Intro, Overview, and Checking).

[Plus, here are my notes from the checking chapter!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZKANhDl3Fk)
