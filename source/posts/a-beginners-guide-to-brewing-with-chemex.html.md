The first book we'll read is [Payments Systems in the US: A Guide For the Payments Professional](https://amzn.to/2Df5aWJ) (affectionately referred to the Glenbrook book) by Carol Cove Benson, Scott Lofesness, and Russ Jones.

## Why the Glenbrook Book?

The Glenbrook book is the gold standard of fintech books - it has been recommended to me countless times. Many fintech companies give a copy of this book to every new hire as required reading to understand the ecosystem.
